This set of files presents a way to setup your directory structures and offers some utilities to help you render off your final project to `.html`, `.pdf`, `docx` and `epub` formats using pandoc.

Provided you have some markdown and all of the essentials installed, you should be able to run makeDocs scripts in the utils directory and burn out a pdf, html, docX and epub.

There might be some complaints about the Math rendering.

To get started, you can have a read of the [readme.md document inside the *chapters* directory](chapters/01_README.md).
